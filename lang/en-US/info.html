<p class="content">Using the MetaMask browser extension and this web application, you can watch events generated by any smart contract on the Ethereum network.<br/>
This web application is especially useful if you are a developer of smart contracts. In this case, you can use MetaMask to connect to the test network and watch events from smart contracts that you are developing.</p>
<h3 class="content">Scope</h3>
<ul>
<li>Events can be filtered by their names.</li>
<li>Displays event time, event name and names and values of event parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="content">How to use</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click on the &quot;<lang:connectBt>&quot;, then the page will request a connection to the blockchain via MetaMask.</li>
<li>After a successful connection, you have to enter the smart contract address and ABI.</li>
<li>The application will start listening the events of this contract after clicking the &quot;<lang:startListenBt>&quot; button.</li>
<li>Use the filter to select only the events you need.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>The web app only works in your browser via MetaMask. Nothing is sent to the application server except the language settings of your browser. But there is one exception: if you decide to donate ether to the developer, your message, your ethereum address and the amount of the donation will be sent to the server.</em></li>
